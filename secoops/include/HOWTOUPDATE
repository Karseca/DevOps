To update iptables rules you can follow the examples below

1. Converting rules
    fwsnort --snort-rfile /etc/snort/rules/ddos.rules
    fwsnort --snort-rdir /etc/snort/rules

2. Donwload rules and install them in /etc/snort/rules and do the following
    fwsnort --include-type backdoor,ddos,web-attacks
    
3. If you want to include only rules from emerging threats ( https://rules.emergingthreats.net/open/snort-2.9.0/rules/ )
    fwsnort --include-type emerging-all

4. If you only want some remote rules you can add one or several lines to your /etc/fwsnort/fwsnort.conf
    ### Default update URL for new rules.  This variable can be given multiple
    ### times on separate lines in order to specify multiple update URL's:
    #UPDATE_RULES_URL       <url1>
    #UPDATE_RULES_URL       <url2>
    UPDATE_RULES_URL        http://rules.emergingthreats.net/open/snort-2.9.0/emerging-all.rules;
    UPDATE_RULES_URL        http://rules.emergingthreats.net/open/snort-2.9.0/rules/emerging-scan.rules;
    
    On the command line execute this command so fwsnort update your remote rules
    fwsnort --update-rules

5. After one of this done all you need is to update iptables with the fwsnort script
    /var/lib/fwsnort/fwsnort_iptcmds.sh
 
Hope you enjoy!
